<h2 id="Yonyou"><a href="#Yonyou" class="headerlink" title="Yonyou"></a>Yonyou</h2><p><a href="http://www.yonyou.com.hk/en/" target="_blank" rel="external">Yonyou</a> (officially Yonyou Software Co.,Ltd, formerly UFIDA Software Co.,Ltd) is the biggest ERP software provider in China. There are over 60 branches in mianland China and overseas branches over the world. I applied for an intern in Wuxi branch, who is resposnible for the market in Wuxi.<br><a id="more"></a><br>During the interview, they introduced me some new directions of Yonyou such as cloud platform, mobile applications.</p>
<h3 id="NC-series"><a href="#NC-series" class="headerlink" title="NC series"></a>NC series</h3><p>Yongyou has differnet level of products for different customers, aslo with different prices. U8,U9 for SME while Yonyou NC series is designed for large group which I work with. It’s a really huge project, and experienced implenting manager need to get familiar with each corner of the system.</p>
<h3 id="UAP-Studio"><a href="#UAP-Studio" class="headerlink" title="UAP Studio"></a>UAP Studio</h3><p>Yonyou has their own IDE called UAP Studio, which is built on Eclipse. With UAP studio, developers can save up to 75% time to generate new models for enterprise.<br>Generally, three kinds of developing jobs will involved during the work: 1 report template development 2 receipt template development 3 interface development. Once the default standard templates cannot satify the requirements of customers, Implementing team will develop new template or even moudule for customer. Interface development appears when different systems need to communicate. Generally, enterprise will have bunch of systems such as ERP, CRM, CAD etc. NC support I/O of xml data files with well-defined interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="Experience"><a href="#Experience" class="headerlink" title="Experience"></a>Experience</h2><p>I was enrolled in the developing department, learning basic report template development. The manager is so friendly that he is willing to answer all my naive questions. </p>
<h3 id="report-template-for-Shuangliang-Group"><a href="#report-template-for-Shuangliang-Group" class="headerlink" title="report template for Shuangliang Group"></a>report template for Shuangliang Group</h3><p>It’s a big project at Shuangliang Boiler Co., Ltd. Team of 7 people consist of 3 developing manager and 4 implementing manager, including my leader. My responsibility here is to transfer 7 reports from their old system to our NC system. The old one is written in Delphi, built on SQL Server. NC6.3 use oracle 11g as database. So the base SQL will be a little difference. These reports are static information for financial accountings, such as monthly report, annual report or comparison report for shipment and receivables.</p>
<p>After a perid of study and discover, I summarised a guide of report template development for novels.</p>
<h3 id="report-template-for-Furen-Group"><a href="#report-template-for-Furen-Group" class="headerlink" title="report template for Furen Group"></a>report template for Furen Group</h3><p>After one month of study and work, I was assigned to another team at Furen High-Tech Co., Ltd, which is made of 4 implementing manager and 2 developing manager. This time, I was responsible alone for the report template development. I could see my name in the responsibility management table. To me, it was stress but also a kind of confirmation to my ability. </p>
<p>Those reports are in bad material management module for after-sale service, which regarded as a branch in inventory management module. I had to extract the data from more than 15 tables inside the database. I got more familiar with the structure of Yonyou’s database design. I recognize a more clear concept to use SQL, especially the join and union commands.</p>
<p>Fortunatily, the formal system is launched on August 1st, 2015 and my part works well!</p>
<h2 id="Sentiment"><a href="#Sentiment" class="headerlink" title="Sentiment"></a>Sentiment</h2><p>I really appreciate this experience. I learn a lot from the system. I learn a lot from the industry. I learn a lot from parterners, managers and people around me. Each of them show a  professional quality. They implemeted so may projects in group level that they are really good at management, regardless of project management or enterprise management.</p>
<p>ERP is a significant product that it make enterprise informatizated regardless of the scale of the enterprise. Honestly, Yonyou still have a lot to do to compete with other provider like SAP. From my point of view, the market is so endless, paticularly SME. They need more personalised or customized product to adapt their situation. For example, Labortory management system, or special management system for spinnig. What i mean is that if I start a undertaking, I will not compete with these mature providers. I would like to focus on vertical market segments to proveide more professional management software for SME.</p>
<p>However, I’m not that socail and aggressive. Maybe I’m more suitable to be a programmer.</p>
<p>At last, thanks to people who helped me in Yonyou. Thanks to  my leader. I missed him a lot.<br><span itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img itemprop="url image" src="/images/semi-annual.jpg" class="full-image" alt="not found :P" title="semi-annual meeting of Wuxi Yonyou"><meta itemprop="width" content="auto"><meta itemprop="height" content="auto"></span><br>Ok, fine, the photo was token by HR, a female… Ignore the star effects.</p>
